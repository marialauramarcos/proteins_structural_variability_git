In this folder I have, for each family:
- family_dataset.csv: pdbid and chain in "family_coordinates.pdb". p.ref is not included. 
- family_coordinates.pdb: coordinates of each protein of the dataset. It was obtained from Homstrad.
- family_alignment.txt: multiple structural alignment of the dataset. It was obtained from Homstrad.
- p.ref_dssp.csv: ACC of each residue calculated with dssp.
- p.ref_functionalSites.csv: indexes of functional sites of p.ref.
- p.ref.pdb: coordinates of p.ref.

(There are some other files, but I am not using them now)
